# Clothorythm
**AI Powered Fashion App**

Clothorythm is a modern fashion-forward web application enhanced with AI capabilities. It aims to revolutionize the way users discover, style, and interact with clothing by offering intelligent outfit recommendations and a sleek, user-centric interface.

## ðŸš€ Why Clothorythm is Different

Instead of relying on preconfigured boilerplates like `create-react-app`, this project was built **from scratch using Parcel** â€” a fast, zero-config bundler. This approach provides:

- ðŸ’¡ Full control over project structure and configuration
- âš¡ Lightning-fast bundling and hot-reloading via Parcel
- ðŸ§± Minimal dependencies and bloat for a cleaner setup
- ðŸ”§ Easier debugging and transparent build process

# Built So Far

- Login/Signup and integration with firebase
- Deployed the project to firebase
- Set up redux store
- Added the authenticated user to Redux store

# Todo

- Add name to firebase
- Navigate based on authentication
